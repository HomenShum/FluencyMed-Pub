Business Model:

The business model for the Fluency Med services is a dual strategy involving both a paid subscription model for patients and a business-to-business (B2B) model for healthcare providers. Services include billing, documentation, administrative work, appointment processes, and diagnostic assistance via semantic search on knowledge database. We focus on selling the service to independent providers, associations, and healthcare software providers, and we help affluent individuals with their specific needs on getting to know their medical needs better while making their process more efficient.

Proof of Market Fit:

Fluency Med services addresses several critical challenges in the healthcare industry, demonstrating a strong market fit. The service helps to reduce physician burnout by streamlining administrative tasks, a common issue in healthcare. It improves patient outcomes by offering diagnostic support and enhancing the online care user experience. By improving physician satisfaction and attracting more medical students to primary care, the service demonstrates that it meets both industry and user needs. Further evidence of market fit comes from its affordability, which appeals to cost-conscious consumers, and the comprehensive nature of its solutions, which fulfill the desire for a one-stop healthcare service.

Traction:

Traction for the Fluency Med services is demonstrated by the numerous activities and initiatives already in progress. Interviews between patients and providers, discussions with pilot customers, and online marketing efforts have generated interest and potential customers. The pilot group, the Christian healthcare group, consisting of 180 physicians serving an estimated patient base of 6,000, showcases the service's operational feasibility. Furthermore, collaborations with healthcare and incubator organizations to help in securing alpha customers, letters of intent, and fund-raising, showing that the service is gaining momentum in the market.

Starting with the patient interface, we can go through the key features.

I have gone through what you have mentioned and understand your anxiety about your son\s eyesight. - 11D and - 8D are high myopic powers and the chances are that the power may progress as your son is still young. My advice to you is: 1. Avoid reading or holding objects very near to the eye. This will cause myopia to progress faster and will worsen the condition. 2. Every six monthly visits or follow up visits as per doctors advise. Since the myopia is of a high degree, there will be excessive stretching and degeneration of the structures of the eyeball. This can cause problems such as retinal detachment. Regular follow-ups help us in picking up changes faster and in preventing such complications as retinal detachment. 3. Ask your son to regularly self-check his vision. This is done by closing each eye one at a time and observing how a particular object or letter looks. In case he is able to pick up any change or ChatDoctor. 4. Urgently visit your doctor in case of a sudden ", """
